The user experience of web mapping applications increases - among other factors
- with the responsiveness of the map and its tools. Application loading time,
drag and zoom speed, layer rendering and query response time can be
significantly reduced, following some simple rules and best practices. This
presentation starts with a demo of a simple map viewer that is assembled from
snippets of example code. We will then look at script building and loading
techniques, OpenLayers configuration tricks, layer grouping, server side tile
caching and the combination of WMS and WFS to build a responsive interactive
map. Applying these techniques step by step, we will see how the viewer
performance increases.
